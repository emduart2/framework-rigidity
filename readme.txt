The goal of this webpage is to provide a place in the web that students and teachers
can use to learn about rigidity of frameworks in an interactive way.
There are two choices one can make to study the rigidity of frameworks using this 
webpage. The first one is to do it through the use of the Wester's Game RTICA.
The second one is to follow the instructions to make the physical models in the community's
fab lab and build the frameworks in the real life.

The first option has been improved in the past by different students participating in the
IGL project and by other students in George's class 198. Thus the main goal of this webpage is
to create a working site in which the student or teacher is able to make the models and have 
an idea of experiments they can work on to understand the rigidity problem better.

There are several components that come into developing the instructions to build the models.
Here is a list of concrete tasks that I plan to perform and put together in the webpage in
a coherent way so that any user who wishes to study this problem may do so.

- Give a brief introduction to the rigidity problem for frameworks in 2D.
- Explain how we can model the frameworks in 2D by using flat rods and pinions.
  These can be built from cardboard and thumbtacks or acrylic and screws.
- Give instructions and provide svg files to create flat rods from cardboard or acrylic.
  This can be done in a laser cutter or a paper cutter.
  Explain different ways to experiment with the rigidity problem.
- Give instructions and provide svg files to print faces of quasicrystal frameworks
  in order to make a pretty model.
- Provide worksheets to experiment with different concepts that come in to play in the study 
  of the rigidity problem.
