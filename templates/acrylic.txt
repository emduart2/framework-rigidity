The following are recommendations to buy acrylic from the website inventables.This is the one that was recommended to me by the people at the fablab.

Make sure the acrylic’s thickness is 1/16in. This ensures the rods are sturdy enough and they don’t bend. If you are working on a tablet this won’t matter too much but if you want to hang up your framework for display, having thinner will make your framework bend.

For the rods I suggest you use opaque acrylic and for the faces I suggest you use translucent. Having translucent acrylic makes the shadow of your framework be of different colors.
