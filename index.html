<h4> Introduction to rigidity of frameworks in 2D</h4>

<p>
A framework in 2D consists of a set of edges in the Eucliden plane that are joined at 
vertices. For our puporses, all of the edges have a fixed length but the angle at the
vertex of a joint is allowed to change. Consider a framework
that consists of just 3 edges which are joined to form a triangle.
It is easy to see that this framework is rigid, the triangle won't
change its shape. However if we consider a framework with four
edges forming a square, we see that the angles at the joints
of the framework may change freely.
</p>

</p>
For this project we will consider frameworks that come from a piece of
a <a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penrose_tiling">
Penrose tiling</a>.  We refer to any such framework as a Penrose framework.
Penrose tilings are made out of two types of rhombi, a skinny one and
a fat one. A face(i.e a rhombus) in the framework can be made rigid by not allowing
the angles at the joints to change and by fixing them to be the angles of
a fat or skinny rhombus. We will refer to the operation of rigidifying a
face of the framework as bracing  the face. If the framework has no
braced faces, it can move freely and all of the faces can change their shapes. If we brace
all the faces of the framework then the only possible motion of the
framework is a rotation as a whole body. What would happen if we
only brace certain faces? Will the framework be rigid? This is
excatly the questions we are intersed in discussing throughout this
project. More precisely:
</p>

<p>
For a given Penrose framework in 2D how many and which faces should I
brace to make the framework rigid?

<a href=
"http://www.math.uiuc.edu/~gfrancis/quasicrystals/quasiIGLtakeTWO.mp4"> Here
</a>  is a short video explaining the rigidity problem for 2D Penrose frameworks.
</p>
<!--p>The goal of this short paragraph is to give an introduction to the
problem of rigidity of frameworks. Say which objects we are going to
study. Say how will we study them. Mention that this problem is good
for computational modeling. We can model using the Rtica for the
Wester game or we can also build physical models.
</p-->

<h4> Modeling rigidity with physical frameworks </h4>

<p>
One way to model the  rigidity problem for  2D frameworks is
to build the frameworks by using rods and joining them at the vertices in such a
way that the angle at a joint may change. For this project we will present how to build acrylic frameworks
by using a laser cutter to make the rods and screws to join them at
the vertices. All you need to do is to follow closely the detailed
instructions
found at the <a href= "frameworks1.html">Framework factory</a>. <br>

The end result will look like the following framework:

To get ideas of how to start studying and understanding the rigidity
problem you can go to the
<a href= "rigiditylab.html"> Rigidity Lab </a>. <br>
</p>


<!--p>
in here I should write a paragraph of what is possible to do using
this webpage. It is pretty much on everything you need to know to
make the frameworks yourself provided you have acces to a laser
printer, acrylic sheets and a computer. MEntion some activities to
understand rigidity of frameworks in general<br>

<h4> Modeling rigidity with Real Time Interactive Animations (RTICAs)
</h4>

<p>
Another way to model the rigidity problem is to use RTICA's. There are
many advantages in the use of RTICA's. For instance,
using a computer you are able to consider bigger frameworks.
Additionally, thinking about how to model the problem in a computer might give
interesting insight on how to solve the rigidity problem for 2D
Penrose frameworks.
</p>

<h4> The punch line</h4>
<p>
If you want to find out how to decide if a braced Penrose framework is
rigid you can experiment with this version of the <a href=
"http://new.math.uiuc.edu/westergame/wgr.html">
Wester Game</a>. Or read our paper  <a href=
"http://new.math.uiuc.edu/quasistable/DuarteFrancisSeville1may13.pdf">
here
</a>.
</p>


<!--p>
in here explain what is possible with the Rticas. Emphasize that the
advantage of the Rticas is that you can check wether a framework is
rigid or not by just bracing things and letting the computer
decide. Based on the Wester game.<br>
